Everyone writes down observations and notes under these categories into post-it notes. Each person then posts their notes on the whiteboard with a very brief explanation of the note - no commentary from others allowed.

Notes are then grouped to remove dupes and to form larger topics (if relevant), and then voted on to get a ranking of importance. Each person gets x votes to mark notes (e.g. 5 votes per 20 notes) and then in the order of highest rank, each note is discussed to find possible actions to take.
